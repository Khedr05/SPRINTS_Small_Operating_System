Enum: EN_PUSH_BTN_state_t

Description	: An enumeration that defines two possible states for a push button: pressed or released.

Members:
-  PUSH_BTN_STATE_PRESSED : Represents the state of a push button when it is pressed down or activated.
-  PUSH_BTN_STATE_RELEASED : Represents the state of a push button when it is not pressed or deactivated.

Overall, the EN_PUSH_BTN_state_t enumeration provides a way to represent the two possible states of a push 
button in a standardized and easy-to-understand manner. By using this enumeration, the software can check the
state of a push button and take appropriate action based on whether it is pressed or released.

/*
Enum: EN_PUSH_BTN_active_t

Description: An enumeration that defines two possible active states for a push button: pull-up or pull-down.

Members:
-  PUSH_BTN_PULL_UP : Represents the active state of a push button when it is connected to a pull-up resistor. 
					  In this state, the button is normally open and the pull-up resistor pulls the voltage of 
					  the pin to a high state.
-  PUSH_BTN_PULL_DOWN : Represents the active state of a push button when it is connected to a pull-down resistor.
						In this state, the button is normally closed and the pull-down resistor pulls the voltage
						of the pin to a low state.

Overall, the EN_PUSH_BTN_active_t enumeration provides a way to represent the two possible active states of a 
push button in a standardized and easy-to-understand manner. By using this enumeration, the software can 
determine the active state of a push button and configure the pin accordingly.

Struct					: ST_PUSH_BTN_t

Description				: A structure that contains the configuration and current state information for a 
						 push button.
Members:
-  PUSH_BTN_pin			: An instance of the ST_pin_config_t struct that contains the configuration settings 
						  for the pin used by the push button.
-  PUSH_BTN_state		: An instance of the EN_PUSH_BTN_state_t enum that represents the current state of 
						  the push button (pressed or released).
-  PUSH_BTN_connection	: An instance of the EN_PUSH_BTN_active_t enum that represents the active state of 
						  the push button (pull-up or pull-down).

Overall, the ST_PUSH_BTN_t structure provides a standardized way to represent and manage the configuration 
and state information for a push button on a micro-controller. By using this structure, the software can easily
read the current state of the push button and take appropriate action based on its configuration and 
connection type. The use of enums for the state and connection fields allows for consistent and 
easy-to-understand representation of these values.
