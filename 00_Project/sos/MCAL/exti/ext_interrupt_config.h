Enum: EN_MCUCR_REG_BITS

Description: An enumeration that defines the bit fields for the `MCUCR` register on a micro-controller.

Members:
-  MCUCR_REG_ISC00_BITS : Represents the bit field for the `ISC00` bit of the `MCUCR` register.
-  MCUCR_REG_ISC01_BITS : Represents the bit field for the `ISC01` bit of the `MCUCR` register.
-  MCUCR_REG_ISC10_BITS : Represents the bit field for the `ISC10` bit of the `MCUCR` register.
-  MCUCR_REG_ISC11_BITS : Represents the bit field for the `ISC11` bit of the `MCUCR` register.


Overall, the EN_MCUCR_REG_BITS enumeration provides a way to represent and manage the individual bit 
fields within the `MCUCR` register on a micro-controller in a standardized and easy-to-understand manner.
By using this enumeration, the software can read and modify the individual bits within this register as 
needed for interrupt configuration and other purposes.

Enum: EN_EXT_INTERRUPT_Sense_Control

Description: An enumeration that defines the possible sense control modes for external 
			 interrupts on a micro-controller.

Members:
- LOW_LEVEL_SENSE_CONTROL    : Represents the sense control mode where the interrupt is triggered when
